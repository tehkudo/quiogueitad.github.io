            <p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My Childhood Years</b> was pretty fun. Especially when I started making friends.<sup>1</sup> I still remember my first day of school, of course like most
                of the first time students, I cried because we were so young and confused.<sup>2</sup> But I got used to it and had fun in my classroom, playing with my classmates and teacher.<sup>3</sup>
                I also had many toys back then that I still cherish up 'til now.<sup>4</sup> I also still have contact on some of my childhood friends and classmates and we still hang out.<sup>5</sup> I forgot the school I
                went to back then, but it's a barangay school.<sup>6</sup> Back in my kindergarten days, I still remember how much fun I had then. Our section even became a small choir back then.
                In my elementary, I transfered to <b><i>Cainta Catholic College (CCC)</b></i> one of the local schools here in Cainta<sup>6</sup>. It was fun because we got to go on a field trip and it was really 
                awesome got to meet a lot of new classmates and made friends with some of them.<sup>7</sup> I had tons of great memories there and I really miss my old school.<sup>8</sup> Every break time me and my 
                classmates hangout around our campus.<sup>9</sup> If we're not hanging around, we play taya-tayaan or bente uno or whatever game we think.<sup>10</sup> Sometimes we just play together on our phones with games.<sup>11</sup> 
                Sometimes, some of my classmates bring guitars so sometimes we just jam along.<sup>12</sup> I still remember waking up in the morning watching cartoons while I eats breakfast.<sup>13</sup> Then, when I was waiting 
                for my mom to pick me up to go home, I play with other kids to pass time.<sup>14</sup> I also still remember our first dog, we name her 'chocolate', she was a very good dog.<sup>15</sup> After we got our first dog we were
                given a second one and we named him 'brownie', then we got a puppy and we named him 'soxy'.<sup>16</sup> When there was no school, I used to hangout and play with my neighbors all day.<sup>17</sup> We play a lot of games, 
                but the most game we played was hide and seek when its evening.<sup>18</sup> And when its christmas time, we often go caroling and spend our money to celebrate.<sup>19</sup> So, all I can say is, my childhood was very good 
                and very fun.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></div>
