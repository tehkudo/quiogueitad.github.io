        <p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In my teenage years</b>, I was still at my old school, <b><i>CCC</b></i>.<sup>1</sup> My teenage years is I think where I learned a lot.<sup>2</sup> Like, how to be matured, commute, 
                basically do mostly anything on my own.<sup>3</sup> I also met more new friends and made some acquaintances along the way.<sup>4</sup> My school experience back then in my highschool was really fun.<sup>5</sup> We got to go to a retreat house back in my old school and we 
                spent 2 days there.<sup>6</sup> I was in a catholic school so in the retreat house we got the opportunity to spend more time and deepen our connection to God.<sup>7</sup> We also played pretty fun games and activities and reflect.<sup>8</sup> Some of my friends 
                from my childhood days, we got more close and we spent times hanging out in malls and some other public attractions.<sup>9</sup> After I moved-up to SHS I started SHS in UE, I was new, so for the first week
                I learned to adjust to my new school and environment.<sup>10</sup> So far, UE was a pretty big change from my last school.<sup>11</sup> I can say that it's a pretty big improvement and I need to adjust.<sup>12</sup> Whenever our school celebrates 'Foundation Day' 
                we got to do hang around the school and go on rides and eat on small food stands.<sup>13</sup> When my school also celebrate Intramurals, we were needed to pick a sport to play, I often pick track and field.<sup>14</sup> I'm a pretty fast runner and I alsmot got first place back then. <sup>15</sup>
                Also, when we're done or just waiting when it's our turn, we go to the gym to play bente uno which was a pretty fun way to pass time.<sup>16</sup> We also sometimes bring sports items like a ball or tennis rackets/ <sup>17</sup> We often use the ball 
                to play dodgeball, because the court is being used by basketball players.<sup>18</sup> So, highscool/teenage years was pretty fun for me. <sup>19</sup>Got to play and hangout with a lot of my new classmates and friends and learn a alot and experience new things.<sup>20</sup>
