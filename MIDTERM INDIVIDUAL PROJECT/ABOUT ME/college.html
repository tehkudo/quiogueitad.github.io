        <p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In my college years</b>, it was tough for me because it started during the pandemic and the class are all online.<sup>1</sup> It was a tough adjustment in the beginning at first but then I got
                used to it overtime.<sup>2</sup> This time because it's online, I don't have to wake up really early to go and commute to UE.<sup>3</sup> Hopefully we can all go back to experience the normal way of
                college.<sup>4</sup> Since it's online, its really annoying when I lose connection, establishing an internet connectivity is crucial in today's time.<sup>5</sup> Although our classes are all online,
                our professors gives us asynchronous classes to ease up a bit.<sup>6</sup> I had a tough time on one of my classes which is PE, because I needed to adjust on the activities we needed to do.<sup>7</sup>
                So far, my experience in online classes is pretty fine.<sup>8</sup> I think face-to-face will be a more fun experience than online.<sup>9</sup> In collge, as expected, I learned a lot of new things because of my course.<sup>10</sup> 
                I learned how to code and it was pretty challenging and fun for me.<sup>11</sup> Challenging, because I didn't quite understand it at first and fun because it was fun solving the problem<sup>12</sup> I understood a lot more about some of the things 
                I have learned before.<sup>13</sup> I was pretty scared go to collge before because I know it will be a challenge.<sup>14</sup> But, I figured I dont really need to be scared, I just need to learn and understand the lessons given to me. <sup>15</sup>
                In my college years, this was also the first time I had saturday classes because of NSTP.<sup>16</sup> I was kind of bored to attend at first because it's saturday, but I needed to.<sup>17</sup> So far, college I feel like is pretty fine to me, there were challenges 
                but I finished them pretty well.<sup>18</sup> But it was pretty tough to learn because I was used to face-to-face and today we mostly stare at the screen and it strains my eyes.<sup>19</sup> So I hope, I get to experience college in the normal way 
                back when there was no pandemic.<sup>20</sup>
