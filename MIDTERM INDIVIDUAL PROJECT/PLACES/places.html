                <h1>Places I Want To Visit</h1>
                <p>Travelling is a part of my dream that I want to accomplish. Seeing the world is really amazing and dreaming it, is too. Travelling pushes us out of our comfort zones, inspiring us to see, taste, and try new things. It constantly challenges us not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with new people, to embrace new and meaningful experiences, and to share them with friends and loved ones. It broadens your perspective by showing how people can do things differently than you and still get by. We grow so accustomed to doing things that we assume it is the only way to do things and that everyone who does things differently is inferior. This changes as you travel. Here are some of the places I want to visit. First is Tokyo, Japan then Niagra Falls in Canada and Paris, France. Click the images below to watch a video tour guide for each places!</p>
