        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
        <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I have developed skills over the years of growing up.<sup>1</sup> Most of them didn't last long.<sup>2</sup> But at least some of them did.<sup>3</sup> One of my skills is Time Management.<sup>4</sup> I can manage my time efficiently.<sup>5</sup> I believe I also have and internal alarm.<sup>6</sup> I can tell myself what time I can wake up.<sup>7</sup> I like managing my schedule because it gives me sight on my free time.<sup>8</sup> With time management I can also prioritize my tasks.<sup>9</sup> With that I can ensure that I have enough time available.<sup>10</sup> One of my other skills are Computer Skills.<sup>11</sup> Growing up I learned how to use a PC and troubleshoot some basic errors.<sup>12</sup> I became really into computers back then.<sup>13</sup> With my knowledge about computers, I built my own.<sup>14</sup> I can also fix my own computer problems/errors.<sup>15</sup> Of course if I need help I ask for it, but most of the time I don't<sup>16</sup> Computers are just interesting for me.<sup>17</sup> Last one of my skills is determination.<sup>18</sup> If I'm determined to do something, I will do it.<sup>19</sup> Of course things will not always come my way, but I just need to find another way to be able to pass through it.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>My main hobby as of now are watching movies/tv shows.<sup>1</sup> I just love the experience I have watching them.<sup>2</sup> Sometime I relate to some of the movies I watch.<sup>3</sup> And I really like how I got immersed to the story.<sup>4</sup> Sometimes if I don't have any movies to watch I just rewatch my favorite TV show which is <i>The Office</i>.<sup>5</sup> Currently, I'm watching <i>Attack on Titan</i> because the story of that is really interesting.<sup>6</sup> I also like to travel, especially if I got the chance.<sup>7</sup> The first time I got to BGC was reall great because it looks like a different country.<sup>8</sup> I guess I got to like travelling because I used to go on a field trip when I was young.<sup>9</sup> Seeing new places and spending time roaming around there is fascinating<sup>10</sup> Another one of my hobbies is gaming.<sup>11</sup> I suppose that's very common today.<sup>12</sup> Growing up I liked video games.<sup>13</sup> It's a different kind of immersion compared to watching movies/shows.<sup>14</sup> There you can control a character and they have their own story.<sup>15</sup> I've played a lot of video games back then.<sup>16</sup> One of those is of course Minecraft because that was really popular up until now.<sup>17</sup> Nowadays I mostly play on my Playstation 5.<sup>18</sup> I play some extreme games with extreme story to tell.<sup>19</sup> Sometimes I play very hard games to challenge myself.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

        <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
        <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>One of my interests today is drawing.<sup>1</sup> I've wanted to learn to draw for a long time.<sup>2</sup> It's very hard to draw since I'm still a beginner.<sup>3</sup> But I just need a lot of time to practice and motivation.<sup>4</sup> I just like the outcome of one's drawing and seeing how good it is.<sup>5</sup> I also like to play some ukulele on my spare time.<sup>6</sup> Unfortunately my ukulele broke so I don't get to use it anymore.<sup>7</sup> One of my other interests is collecting something.<sup>8</sup> As of now I have collected 16 Funko Pops.<sup>9</sup> Funko pops or just pops are these small vinyl figures of characters from movies, tv shows, etc.<sup>10</sup> Growing up I just like collecting toys and figures.<sup>11</sup> It's really fun seeing movie/cartoon characters complete in your collection.<sup>12</sup> Of course one of my interests are computers or tech in general.<sup>13</sup> I like having great/high quality tech/peripherals because I think they're worth your money.<sup>14</sup> Another interest I have is editing which I got like 4 or 5 years ago.<sup>15</sup> Something with editing just feels right.<sup>16</sup> I can edit funny stuff in, make the video representable and amusing.<sup>17</sup> But I don't edit anymore lately since I'm busy.<sup>18</sup> So those are some of my interests, I got to get more interest along the way but sometimes it doesn't really go anywhere.<sup>19</sup> I just need to find the right interest for me where I find it amusing, fun, and that will really grab my attention.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
